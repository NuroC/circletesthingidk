## a circle generator thing i tried but idk i gave up

### what I tried doing:

- algorithm that checks if a circle is too close to another (almost done it sucks but kind of works)
- alogirhtm to check if a point is outside of the canvas (i totally failed that)
- an algorithm that calculates the best route to come from a point to another point (didnt even start since i failed other)
- make a "subway likely" simulator which this was supposed to be 


i did this in a few hours and lost hope, i might continue it later
